🚀 Excited to share my latest project: Swiggy Dashboard Restaurants Analysis ! 📊

In this project, I analyzed Swiggy’s restaurant data in Bangalore to uncover key insights on restaurant ratings, top cuisines, high-end dining, and location-based distribution. Using Power BI, I developed an interactive dashboard that provides valuable insights into Bangalore’s vibrant food scene.

💡 Key Highlights:
